\item Define trial, outcome, and sample space.

\item Explain why the long-run relative frequency of repeated independent events settle down to the true probability as the number of trials increases, i.e. why the law of large numbers holds.

\item Distinguish disjoint (also called mutually exclusive) and independent events.
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] If A and B are independent, then having information on A does not tell us anything about B.
\item[-] If A and B are disjoint, then knowing that A occurs tells us that B cannot occur.
\item[-] Disjoint (mutually exclusive) events are always dependent since if one event occurs we know the other one cannot.
\end{itemize}

\item Draw Venn diagrams representing events and their probabilities.

\item Describe properties of probability distributions.

\item Define complementary events as two events whose probabilities add up to 1.

\item Distinguish between union of events (A or B) and intersection of events (A and B).
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Calculate the probability of union of events using the (general) addition rule.
\item[-] Calculate the probability of intersection of independent events using the multiplication rule.
\end{itemize}

\item P(A) = 0.5, P(B) = 0.6, there are no other possible outcomes in the sample space. What is P(A and B)?

Create a contingency table and a tree diagram summarizing these probabilities. Calculate the percentage of students in this class who are in a relationship.
